# Causal-Graph-Learning

Welcome to **Causal Graph Learning**!  
This repository is designed as a comprehensive resource for exploring, understanding, and experimenting with causal graph inference and learning methodologies. The project is particularly suited for students, educators, and researchers in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence, offering hands-on experience with modern tools and pedagogies.

---

## 📖 Overview

Causal graphs are foundational for representing and reasoning about cause-and-effect relationships in complex systems. This repository provides a structured curriculum and practical tools to guide you through the theory and application of causal inference, leveraging Python and modern deep learning frameworks.

All materials are compiled into a Jupyter Book, making the content interactive and easy to follow. The main focus areas include:
- Theoretical foundations of causal inference
- Practical implementation with Python and PyTorch
- Experimentation using Jupyter notebooks

---

## ✨ Features

- **Comprehensive Jupyter Notebooks**: Step-by-step tutorials and experiment guides.
- **PyTorch Integration**: Utilize state-of-the-art deep learning libraries for causal modeling.
- **Reproducible Experiments**: All course materials and code are designed for reproducibility.
- **Cloud-ready**: Instructions for running the environment using Conda and cloud services.
- **References and Further Reading**: Curated bibliography for deep dives into causal inference.
